    "text": "This website contains multiple web-based tables of baseline descriptive statistics for (nearly) every follow-up interview variable collected as part of the DETECT study between 2018 and 2024. For more information about the DETECT project, please see the primary public repository.\nFor questions related to DETECT, please contact Dr. Brad Cannell at Michael.B.Cannell@uth.tmc.edu.\n\n\nEach month, MedStar treats many older adults in their homes. While they are there, they are also supposed to screen for elder mistreatment (EM) using the DETECT tool. Currently, approximately 1,600 of those screenings are being completed each month.\nEvery two weeks, our call center received a list of patients that were screened with the DETECT tool during the previous two weeks. For example, on the 15th of March, they would receive a list of all the people who were treated by MedStar and screened with the DETECT tool between March 1 and March 14. The call center would then call every person on that list and attempt to schedule them for a follow-up interview. Our inital target was 70 of these interviews per month. In reality, we averaged around 30. Follow-up interviews were scheduled for people who passed the initial screening and agreed to participate.\n\n\n\n\n\nA specially trained MedStar Community Paramedic traveled to patients’ homes to conduct the follow-up interviews. They typically took between 1 and 2 hours. At the end of the interview, the participant received a $25 WalMart gift card. All data was collected and stored in FileMaker Pro.\nDETECT Project Timeline"
